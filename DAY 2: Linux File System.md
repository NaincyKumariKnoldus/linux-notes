### what are loop devices?
 A loop device, or it can be termed as vnode disk (vnd), and loopback file interface (lofi) is a device that helps the computer file to access block devices. Before using the dev loop, the existing file in the file system must be connected to it.
The “losetup” command-line tool is used to connect loop devices with the block devices. It helps to disconnect devices and check the query status of the dev loop. The syntax of the “losetup” command is: \
 `$ losetup {options}`
