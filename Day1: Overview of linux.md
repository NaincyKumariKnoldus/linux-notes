### What is the GNU project?
   GNU stands for GNU's not Unix. The GNU project is a mass collaborative initiative for the development of free software. The original purpose of the GNU project was the creation of a free operating system. Free, in a software context, does not necessarily mean free of cost. The freedom referred to is the ability of anyone who wishes to run, copy, distribute, study, change and improve the software. According to the GNU Linux project, the Linux operating system's kernel is Linux but all other elements of the system are GNU.  According to the project,  neither OS exists independently and, as such Linux would more appropriately be called GNU Linux.
### Difference between Unix and Linux?
 * Linux is an open-source operating system which is freely available to everyone. Whereas Unix is an operating system which can be only used by its copywriters.
 * Linux is just the kernel, whereas Unix is a complete package of Operating systems.
 * BASH is the Linux default shell. It offers support for multiple command interpreters. Unix Originally made it work in Bourne Shell. However, it is now compatible with many other software.
 * Linux source is available to the general public whereas unix source code is not available to anyone.
 
 ### What is UEFI? Difference between UEFI and BIOS?
 The BIOS (basic input/output system) is a firmware component stored in nonvolatile memory, usually a flash chip.The BIOS loads the boot loader, which is the first software component loaded during the boot process. \
 The boot loader is stored in the hard drive, together with the operating system and applications. \
 UEFI stands for Unified Extensible Firmware Interface. It does the same job as a BIOS, but with one basic difference: it stores all data about initialization and startup in an .efi file, instead of storing it on the firmware.
 UEFI was designed to overcome many limitations of the old BIOS, including: \
 * UEFI supports drive sizes upto 9 zettabytes, whereas BIOS only supports 2.2 terabytes.
 * UEFI has discrete driver support, while BIOS has drive support stored in its ROM, so updating BIOS firmware is a bit difficult.
 * UEFI offers security like "Secure Boot", which prevents the computer from booting from unauthorized/unsigned applications. This helps in preventing rootkits, but also hampers dual-booting, as it treats other OS as unsigned applications.
 * UEFI runs in 32bit or 64bit mode, whereas BIOS runs in 16bit mode. So UEFI  is able to provide a GUI (navigation with mouse) as opposed to BIOS which allows navigation only using the keyboard.
 
 ### When should I go for Ubuntu & when for other systems?
1. Free of Cost
Downloading and installing Ubuntu is free, and costs only time to install it. One can just download from the internet or can create an ISO bootable disk, and after it, the environment is ready to launch.
2. Privacy
In comparison to Windows, Ubuntu provides a better option for privacy and security. The best advantage of having Ubuntu is that we can acquire the required privacy and additional security without having any third party solution. Risk of hacking and various other attacks can be minimized by using this distribution.
3. Working with Partitions of hard drives
Linux live CD and Gparted enable to divide the hard disk into partitions. This feature is also applicable when your system is a dual or triple boot. Otherwise, the partition is helpful in migration to solid state drive or more spacious drive. Apart from this, wiping of data can be easily done in Ubuntu.
4. Free Apps
Ubuntu provides a lot of free apps to explore the world of opportunities, refreshments, and enjoyment. Following are few apps of total listed below
Spotify
Skype
Firefox
Telegram
5. User-Friendly
Ubuntu is as easy as the Windows operating system. There is a well-known myth about Ubuntu is that Ubuntu is developed for developers and coders only. But the actual fact is, Ubuntu is a beautiful desktop operating system and can be used by any common computer user.
 
6 Say Bye to Antivirus
Risk of having a virus or malware is minimal, that reduces the cost of anti-virus software. Antivirus is also a reason for the slowness of the computer system and affects performance badly
